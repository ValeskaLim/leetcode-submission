# Leetcode Submission

This repository contains all of my leetcode submissions. The purpose is to track my progress. Created using <a href='https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/LeetHub-2.0'>LeetHub-2.0</a>

Mostly using Java to solve problems. because I like Java :D (forced)

UPDATE: Will be using LeetHub-3.0 as LeetHub-2.0 is not compatible with Leetcode anymore since the latest update. Here's the link if you want to use LeetHub-3.0 <a href='https://github.com/raphaelheinz/LeetHub-3.0'>LeetHub-3.0</a>
